this is **very initial** version of a [Flow Launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher)
 weather plugin, and it may not work as expected. it's not yet published to the Flow Launcher plugin store (https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher.PluginsManifest). i'd like if you could improve it.

# Install 

`pm install https://github.com/adielBm/Flow.Launcher.Plugin.Weather/releases/download/v1.0.0/Flow.Launcher.Plugin.Weather.zip`
