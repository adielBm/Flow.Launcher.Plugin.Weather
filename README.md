- this is **very initial** version of a [Flow Launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher) weather plugin, and it may not work as expected.
- it's not yet published to the Flow Launcher plugin store (https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher.PluginsManifest). 
- i'd like if you could improve it.
